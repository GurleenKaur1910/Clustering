# Clustering on Wine Dataset

This notebook performs clustering on the UCI Wine Dataset using different preprocessing techniques like normalization, log transform, PCA, and a combination of transformations.

It applies three clustering algorithms:

K-Means

Agglomerative Clustering

Mean Shift

Each model is evaluated using:

Silhouette Score

Calinski-Harabasz Score

Davies-Bouldin Score

The goal is to compare how preprocessing impacts clustering performance.
